# Building the RSDKv5 & Sonic Mania Decompilations

The RSDKv5 and Sonic Mania decompilations use [CMake](https://cmake.org/), a versatile building system that supports many different compilers and platforms.

## Read before proceeding

This guide requires basic knowledge of how to use the appropriate terminal for your OS, such as Command Prompt for Windows. If you aren't familiar with doing basic actions with terminals, such as opening one in specific directories, look up a tutorial online.

In addition, refer to these warnings depending on the platform you are compiling for:

=== "Windows"

    !!! warning
        Make sure to use Command Prompt when typing commands instead of PowerShell, as PowerShell is known to cause issues.

=== "Linux"

    !!! warning "Notice for Steam Deck users"
        Due to how SteamOS handles packages, building the decompilation on the Steam Deck is highly difficult and not recommended. Instead, consider building it on another Arch Linux device and using that build on the Steam Deck.

## Get the source code
**DO NOT** download the source code ZIP archive from GitHub, as they do not include the submodules required to build the decompilation.

Instead, you will need to clone the repository using Git, which you can get [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Clone the repo **recursively** by running this command in the target directory:
=== "RSDKv5 + Sonic Mania"

    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/Sonic-Mania-Decompilation
    ```

    !!! warning
        **DO NOT** clone the repository in a Windows user directory. This includes folders such as Documents, Downloads, and the Desktop. These directories are known to cause issues when building. It's recommended to instead clone the repo somewhere in a `GitHub` folder located in the root of the C drive, or another drive entirely if possible.

    Then, run this command inside of the repository to ensure RSDKv5 is up-to-date:
    ```
    git submodule update --remote --init
    ```

=== "RSDKv5 Only"

    ```
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv5-Decompilation
    ```

    !!! warning
        **DO NOT** clone the repository in a Windows user directory. This includes folders such as Documents, Downloads, and the Desktop. These directories are known to cause issues when building. It's recommended to instead clone the repo somewhere in a `GitHub` folder located in the root of the C drive, or another drive entirely if possible.

If you'd ever like to update the cloned repository, you can do so by running these commands in it:
```
git pull
git submodule update --remote --init
```

## Getting dependencies
=== "Windows"

    [Install CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). **Make sure to enable the feature to add CMake to the system PATH during the installation.**

    To handle dependencies, you'll need to install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the `Desktop development with C++` workload. If you already have Visual Studio installed, you can manage your installed workloads by opening Visual Studio Installer from the Start Menu and clicking the `Modify` button next to your Visual Studio installation.

    !!! warning
        An installation of Visual Studio with the `Desktop development with C++` workload uses around 8 GB of storage space. Make sure you have the necessary space on your drive before proceeding.

    You will also need to [set up vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd#1---set-up-vcpkg). You only need to follow `1 - Set up vcpkg` in the guide.

    !!! tip
        It's recommended to clone vcpkg into a short path such as `C:/src` to avoid potential file path issues.

    Run the following command in the vcpkg repository:
    === "64-bit"

        ```
        vcpkg.exe install libtheora libogg glew glfw3 sdl2 --triplet=x64-windows-static
        ```

    === "32-bit"

        ```
        vcpkg.exe install libtheora libogg glew glfw3 sdl2 --triplet=x86-windows-static
        ```

    Then, add vcpkg to your environment variables by running the following commands in the vcpkg repository:
    ```
    set VCPKG_ROOT="%CD%"
    setx VCPKG_ROOT %VCPKG_ROOT%
    ```

=== "Linux"

    Run the following command in the terminal:

    === "pacman (Arch)"

        ```
        sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake glew glfw libtheora sdl2
        ```

    === "apt (Debian/Ubuntu)"

        ```
        sudo apt install build-essential cmake libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libtheora-dev libsdl2-dev
        ```

    === "rpm (Fedora)"

        ```
        sudo dnf install make cmake gcc glew-devel glfw-devel libtheora-devel SDL2-devel zlib-devel
        ```

    === "apk (Alpine/PostmarketOS)"

        ```
        sudo apk add build-base cmake gcc glew-dev glfw-dev libtheora-dev sdl2-dev
        ```

    === "xbps (Void)"

        ```
        sudo xbps-install make cmake gcc pkg-config glew-devel glfw-devel libtheora-devel SDL2-devel zlib-devel
        ```

=== "Nintendo Switch"

    [Set up devKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started), then run the following command:
    ```
    (dkp-)pacman -Syuu switch-dev switch-libogg switch-libtheora switch-sdl2 switch-glad
    ```

=== "Android"

    Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

    === "RSDKv5 + Sonic Mania"

        Download the ZIP archives for **libogg** and **libtheora** from [xiph.org](https://xiph.org/downloads/), then extract and place the `libogg-X.X.X` and `libtheora-X.X.X` folders into `Sonic-Mania-Decompilation/dependencies/RSDKv5/dependencies/android`. Rename the folders `libogg` and `libtheora`, respectively.

        Navigate to `Sonic-Mania-Decompilation/dependencies/RSDKv5/android/app/jni` and create the symbolic links in the following table in that directory:

    === "RSDKv5 Only"

        Download the ZIP archives for **libogg** and **libtheora** from [xiph.org](https://xiph.org/downloads/), then extract and place the `libogg-X.X.X` and `libtheora-X.X.X` folders into `RSDKv5-Decompilation/dependencies/android`. Rename the folders `libogg` and `libtheora`, respectively.

        Navigate to `RSDKv5-Decompilation/android/app/jni` and create the symbolic links in the following table in that directory:

    | Symlink Name                         | Path                                                                                |
    | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `Game`                               | Path to `Sonic-Mania-Decompilation` (or any other game you'd like to build)         |
    | Name of any mod(s) you'd like to add | Path to the directory for the mod's code containing a `CMakeLists.txt` file         |

    !!! question "How do I make a symbolic link?"
        You can create a symlink using the appropriate command:

        - Windows: `mklink /d "[symlink-name]" "[path]"` (or use [Link Shell Extension](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html))
        - Linux: `ln -s "[path]" "[symlink-name]"`

## Compiling
=== "Windows"

    Enter the following commands in the RSDKv5/Mania decompilation repository directory:
    === "64-bit"

        ```
        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static
        cmake --build build --config release
        ```

    === "32-bit"

        ```
        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x86-windows-static -A Win32
        cmake --build build --config release
        ```

    The resulting build(s) will be located somewhere in `build/` depending on your system. If you built RSDKv5 and Sonic Mania together, Sonic Mania (`Game.dll`) will be found in `build` while RSDKv5 (`RSDKv5(U).exe`) will be found in `build/dependencies/RSDKv5`.

    You can set [build flags](#build-flags) by adding `-D[flag-name]=[value]` to the end of the first command.

=== "Linux"

    Enter the following commands in the RSDKv5/Mania decompilation repository directory:
    ```
    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build --config release
    ```

    The resulting build(s) will be located somewhere in `build/` depending on your system. If you built RSDKv5 and Sonic Mania together, Sonic Mania (`libGame.so`) will be found in `build` while RSDKv5 (`RSDKv5(U)`) will be found in `build/dependencies/RSDKv5`.

    You can set [build flags](#build-flags) by adding `-D[flag-name]=[value]` to the end of the first command.

=== "Nintendo Switch"

    Enter the following commands in the RSDKv5/Mania decompilation repository directory:
    ```
    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/devkitpro/cmake/Switch.cmake
    cmake --build build --config release
    ```

    The resulting build will be located somewhere in `build/` depending on your system.

    You can set [build flags](#build-flags) by adding `-D[flag-name]=[value]` to the end of the first command.

=== "Android"

    TODO: Be more descriptive

    === "RSDKv5 + Sonic Mania"

        Open `Sonic-Mania-Decompilation/dependencies/RSDKv5/android/` in Android Studio, install the NDK and everything else that it asks for, and build.

    === "RSDKv5 Only"

        Open `RSDKv5-Decompilation/android/` in Android Studio, install the NDK and everything else that it asks for, and build.

## Build Flags
!!! warning
    These build flags modify certain aspects of the decomps; only use these if you know what you're doing!

## Troubleshooting

### CMake error: "Cannot find source file" { id="cannot-find-source-file" }

=== "RSDKv5 + Sonic Mania"

    You did not clone the repository recursively, meaning the submodules are missing. You can get them by running the following command in the `Sonic-Mania-Decompilation` directory:

=== "RSDKv5 Only"

    You did not clone the repository recursively, meaning the submodules are missing. You can get them by running the following command in the `RSDKv5-Decompilation` directory:

```
git submodule update --remote --init
```

### Android Studio error: "INTERNAL: readdir: No such file or directory" { id="android-internal-readdir" }

=== "RSDKv5 + Sonic Mania"

    This error occurs if your path is long enough to build, but too long to rebuild. Deleting `Sonic-Mania-Decompilation/dependencies/RSDKv5/android/app/build` and attempting to build again should fix it.

=== "RSDKv5 Only"

    This error occurs if your path is long enough to build, but too long to rebuild. Deleting `RSDKv5-Decompilation/android/app/build` and attempting to build again should fix it.

### Android Studio error: "Interrupt/exception caught (code = 0xc0000005)" { id="android-exception-code-05" }

This error occurs if your path is too long. Try moving the repository to a directory with a shorter path, such as a `GitHub` folder located in the root of the drive.
