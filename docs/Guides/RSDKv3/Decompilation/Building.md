# Building the RSDKv3 Decompilation

The RSDKv3 Decompilation uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/), a versatile building system that supports many different compilers and platforms.

## Read before proceeding

This guide requires basic knowledge of how to use the appropriate terminal for your OS, such as Command Prompt for Windows. If you aren't familiar with doing basic actions with terminals, such as opening one in specific directories, look up a tutorial online.

In addition, refer to these warnings depending on the platform you are compiling for:

=== "Windows"

    !!! warning
        Make sure to use Command Prompt when typing commands instead of PowerShell, as PowerShell is known to cause issues.

=== "Linux"

    !!! warning "Notice for Steam Deck users"
        Due to how SteamOS handles packages, building the decompilation on the Steam Deck is highly difficult and not recommended. Instead, consider building it on another Arch Linux device and using that build on the Steam Deck.

=== "Android"

## Get the source code
**DO NOT** download the source code ZIP archive from GitHub, as they do not include the submodules required to build the decompilation.

Instead, you will need to clone the repository using Git, which you can get [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Clone the repo **recursively** by running this command in the target directory:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv3-Decompilation
```

!!! warning
    **DO NOT** clone the repository in a Windows user directory. This includes folders such as Documents, Downloads, and the Desktop. These directories are known to cause issues when building. It's recommended to instead clone the repo somewhere in a `GitHub` folder located in the root of the C drive, or another drive entirely if possible.

If you'd ever like to update the cloned repository, you can do so by running these commands in it:
```
git pull
git submodule update --remote --init
```

## Getting dependencies
=== "Windows"

    [Install CMake](https://cmake.org/download/). **Make sure to enable the feature to add CMake to the system PATH during the installation.**

    To handle dependencies, you'll need to install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the `Desktop development with C++` workload. If you already have Visual Studio installed, you can manage your installed workloads by opening Visual Studio Installer from the Start Menu and clicking the `Modify` button next to your Visual Studio installation.

    !!! warning
        An installation of Visual Studio with the `Desktop development with C++` workload uses around 8 GB of storage space. Make sure you have the necessary space on your drive before proceeding.

    You will also need to [set up vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd#1---set-up-vcpkg). You only need to follow `1 - Set up vcpkg` in the guide.

    !!! tip
        It's recommended to clone vcpkg into a short path such as `C:/src` to avoid potential file path issues.

    Run the following command in the vcpkg repository:
    === "64-bit"

        ```
        vcpkg.exe install glew sdl2 libogg libtheora libvorbis --triplet=x64-windows-static
        ```

    === "32-bit"

        ```
        vcpkg.exe install glew sdl2 libogg libtheora libvorbis --triplet=x86-windows-static
        ```

    Then, add vcpkg to your environment variables by running the following commands in the vcpkg repository:
    ```
    set VCPKG_ROOT="%CD%"
    setx VCPKG_ROOT %VCPKG_ROOT%
    ```

=== "Linux"

    Run the following command in the terminal:

    === "pacman (Arch)"

        ```
        sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake glew sdl2 libogg libtheora libvorbis
        ```

    === "apt (Debian/Ubuntu)"

        ```
        sudo apt install build-essential cmake libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libsdl2-dev libogg-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev
        ```

    === "rpm (Fedora)"

        ```
        sudo dnf install make gcc cmake glew-devel glfw-devel SDL2-devel libogg-devel libtheora-devel libvorbis-devel zlib-devel
        ```

    === "apk (Alpine/PostmarketOS)"

        ```
        sudo apk add build-base cmake glew-dev glfw-dev sdl2-dev libogg-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev
        ```

    === "xbps (Void)"

        ```
        sudo xbps-install make cmake pkg-config glew-devel glfw-devel SDL2-devel libogg-devel libtheora-devel libvorbis-devel  zlib-devel
        ```

=== "Android"

    Download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

    Download the ZIP archives for **libogg**, **libvorbis**, and **libtheora** from [xiph.org](https://xiph.org/downloads/), then extract and place the `libogg-X.X.X`, `libvorbis-X.X.X`, and `libtheora-X.X.X` folders into `RSDKv3-Decompilation/dependencies/android`. Rename the folders `libogg`, `libvorbis`, and `libtheora` respectively.

    Download the [source code for SDL version 2.28.3](https://libsdl.org/release/SDL2-2.28.3.zip), then extract and place the `SDL2-2.28.3` folder into `RSDKv3-Decompilation/dependencies/android`. Rename the folder `SDL2`.

    Download the **binaries** for GLEW from [glew.sourceforge.net](https://glew.sourceforge.net/), then extract and place the `glew-X.X.X` folder into `RSDKv3-Decompilation/dependencies/android`. Rename the folder `glew`.

    Navigate to `RSDKv3-Decompilation/android/app/jni` and delete the `src` file in it, then create the symbolic links in the following table in that directory:

    | Symlink Name | Path                                                     |
    | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `SDL`        | Path to `RSDKv3-Decompilation/dependencies/android/SDL2` |
    | `src`        | Path to `RSDKv3-Decompilation`                           |

    !!! question "How do I make a symbolic link?"
        You can create a symlink using the appropriate command:

        - Windows: `mklink /d "[symlink-name]" "[path]"` (or use [Link Shell Extension](https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/hardlinkshellext/linkshellextension.html))
        - Linux: `ln -s "[path]" "[symlink-name]"`

## Compiling
=== "Windows"

    Enter the following commands in the RSDKv3 decompilation repository directory:
    === "64-bit"

        ```
        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="%VCPKG_ROOT%/installed/x64-windows-static/"
        cmake --build build --config release
        ```

    === "32-bit"

        ```
        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x86-windows-static -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="%VCPKG_ROOT%/installed/x86-windows-static/" -A Win32
        cmake --build build --config release
        ```

    The resulting build will be located somewhere in `build/` depending on your system.

    You can set [build flags](#build-flags) by adding `-D[flag-name]=[value]` to the end of the first command.

=== "Linux"

    Enter the following commands in the RSDKv3 decompilation repository directory:
    ```
    cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build --config release
    ```

    The resulting build will be located somewhere in `build/` depending on your system.

    You can set [build flags](#build-flags) by adding `-D[flag-name]=[value]` to the end of the first command.

=== "Android"

    TODO: Be more descriptive

    Open `RSDKv3-Decompilation/android/` in Android Studio, install the NDK and everything else that it asks for, and build.

## Build Flags
!!! warning
    These build flags modify certain aspects of the decomp; only use these if you know what you're doing!

| Flag                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Value Type           | Default Value |

| **RETRO_SDL_VERSION**            | Switches between using SDL 1.2 or SDL 2.                                                                                                                                                                            | Integer (`1` or `2`) | `2`           |

## Troubleshooting

### CMake error: "Cannot find source file" { id="cmake-cannot-find-source-file" }

You did not clone the repository recursively, meaning the submodules are missing. You can get them by running the following command in the `RSDKv3-Decompilation` directory:
```
git submodule update --remote --init
```

### Android Studio error: "INTERNAL: readdir: No such file or directory" { id="android-internal-readdir" }

This error occurs if your path is long enough to build, but too long to rebuild. Deleting `RSDKv3-Decompilation/android/app/build` and attempting to build again should fix it.

### Android Studio error: "Interrupt/exception caught (code = 0xc0000005)" { id="android-exception-code-05" }

This error occurs if your path is too long. Try moving the repository to a directory with a shorter path, such as a `GitHub` folder located in the root of the drive.
