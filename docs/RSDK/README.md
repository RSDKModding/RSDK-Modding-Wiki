# Retro Engine

The Retro Engine is a 2D video game engine created by [Christian Whitehead](TODO) and owned by [Evening Star](TODO). The engine is designed for retro-style games with pixel art graphics, supporting features such as palette manipulation, shape rasterization, and 3D floors and skies reminiscent of the Super Nintendo's [Mode 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_7) technology.
