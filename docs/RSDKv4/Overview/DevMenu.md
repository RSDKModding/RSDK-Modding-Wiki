# Dev Menu

The Dev Menu is a debug menu included with [RSDKv4](../README.md), disabled by default. The menu includes several features useful for debugging games in the engine.

## Enabling
The Dev Menu is normally inaccessible, however in the [RSDKv4 Decompilation](../Decompilation/README.md), it can be enabled by setting `DevMenu` to `true` in the settings.ini file, like so:

``` ini hl_lines="3"
[Dev]
; Enable this flag to activate dev menu via the ESC key
DevMenu=true ; (1)!
; Enable this flag to activate features used for debugging the engine (may result in slightly slower game speed)
EngineDebugMode=false
; Enable this flag to force the engine to load from the scripts folder instead of from bytecode
TxtScripts=false
...
```

1. Make sure that the decomp is not running while editing settings.ini; otherwise, your changes will be reverted upon closing the decomp.

## Menu

You can open the Dev Menu at any time in the [RSDKv4 Decompilation](../Decompilation/README.md) by pressing ++escape++ or by selecting it in the Help & Options or pause menus.

## Other Effects

When the Dev Menu is enabled in the [RSDKv4 Decompilation](../Decompilation/README.md), the global variable `options.devMenuFlag` is set to `true` upon loading the GameConfig, if such global variable exists.
