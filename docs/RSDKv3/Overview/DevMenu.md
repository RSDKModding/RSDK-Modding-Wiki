# Dev Menu

The Dev Menu is a debug menu included with [RSDKv3](../README.md), disabled by default. The menu includes several features useful for debugging games in the engine.

## Enabling
=== "Blit"

    The Dev Menu can be enabled by editing the game's `GameConfig.bin` file to set the default value of the `Options.DevMenuFlag` global variable to 1 (`true`).

=== "RSDKv3 Decompilation"

    The Dev Menu can be enabled by setting `DevMenu` to `true` in the settings.ini file, like so:

    ``` ini hl_lines="3"
    [Dev]
    ; Enable this flag to activate dev menu via the ESC key
    DevMenu=true ; (1)!
    ; Enable this flag to activate features used for debugging the engine (may result in slightly slower game speed)
    EngineDebugMode=false
    ; Enable this flag to force the engine to load from the scripts folder instead of from bytecode
    TxtScripts=false
    ...
    ```

    1. Make sure that the decomp is not running while editing settings.ini; otherwise, your changes will be reverted upon closing the decomp.

## Menu

You can open the Dev Menu in Sonic CD by selecting it the pause menu, as well as the Help & Options menu in the mobile version. In the [RSDKv3 Decompilation](../Decompilation/README.md), you can also open it at any time by pressing ++escape++.

## Other Effects

When the Dev Menu is enabled, the global variable `Options.DevMenuFlag` is set to `true` upon loading the GameConfig, if such global variable exists.
