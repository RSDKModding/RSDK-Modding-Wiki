# NOTIFY_CHARACTER_SELECT

## Description
Opens Sonic Origins's character select menu, then sets `callbackResult` and `continueFlag` when the menu is closed.

## Parameters
`skipMenu`

:   If true, skips the character select and automatically loads the save slot for the current character.

## Return Value
=== "v3"

    If the menu is backed out of without selecting a save slot, `game.callbackResult` is set to `0`; otherwise, it's set to `1`. If the selected save slot is an existing save, `game.continueFlag` is set to `true`.

=== "v4"

    If the menu is backed out of without selecting a save slot, `game.callbackResult` is set to `0`; otherwise, it's set to `1`. If the selected save slot is an existing save, `game.continueFlag` is set to `true`.

=== "v5"

    If the menu is backed out of without selecting a save slot, `globals->callbackResult` is set to `0`; otherwise, it's set to `1`. If the selected save slot is an existing save, `globals->continueFlag` is set to `true`.
