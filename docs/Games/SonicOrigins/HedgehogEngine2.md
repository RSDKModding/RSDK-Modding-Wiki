TODO: This page is a stub; it needs more info

Hedgehog Engine 2 (also referred to as HE2) is a game engine created by Sonic Team. The engine is a successor to the original Hedgehog Engine. The engine debuted in 2016 with Mario & Sonic at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, and has been used in several other SEGA games since, such as Sonic Forces, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, and [Sonic Origins](README.md).

## Sonic Origins

In addition to Hedgehog Engine 2, Sonic Origins also incorporates [Retro Engine v5U](../../RSDKv5/README.md) as a backend to run the four playable remasters in the collection.
