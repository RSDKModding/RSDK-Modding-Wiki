# GameAPI

GameAPI is a custom-made bindings API for games made for [Retro Engine v5](/RSDKv5/README.md), specifically for its [decompilation](/RSDKv5/Decompilation/README.md). The API is available for both C and C++. The C bindings are based on [RSDKv5 Object Code](TODO) when transpiled to C, whereas the C++ bindings are based loosely on [Sonic 3 & Knuckles](TODO)'s C++ code.

## ModAPI

GameAPI supports the RSDKv5 Decompilation's ModAPI, which allows creating mods for RSDKv5 games and provides some additional functionality.
