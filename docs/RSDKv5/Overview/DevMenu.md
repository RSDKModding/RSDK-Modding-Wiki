# Dev Menu

The Dev Menu is a debug menu included with [RSDKv5](../README.md), disabled by default. The menu includes several features useful for debugging games in the engine. When the Dev Menu is enabled, other developer features are accessible as well.

## Enabling

The Dev Menu can be enabled by adding the line `devMenu=y` under the `Game` category of the engine's settings.ini file, like so:

``` ini hl_lines="4"
; Retro Engine Config File

[Game]
devMenu=y ; (1)!
language=0

...
```

1. The setting names in settings.ini are case-sensitive; the Dev Menu setting will not apply if the capitalization is incorrect.

Alternatively, running the game in [Data Folder Mode](TODO) will automatically enable the Dev Menu.

!!! note
    The entirety of the Dev Menu was removed in [Sonic Origins](/Games/SonicOrigins/README.md), making it inaccessible.
